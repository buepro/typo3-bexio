============
Introduction
============

This extension provides a client for the `Bexio API <https://docs.bexio.com/>`__
by extending the client from the package
`onlime/bexio-api-client <https://github.com/onlime/bexio-api-client>`__.

Usage
=====

Following these steps to use the client:

#. Carry out the setup as outlined in the :ref:`administration manual <admin>`

#. Authenticate the usage by loading the authentication url
   (`https://your-domain.ch/bexio-auth-your_challange`). You will be redirected
   to the bexio authentication server. Upon successful authentication a tokens
   file will be obtained.

#. Get a client from the ApiService

   .. code-block:: php

      use Buepro\Bexio\Service\ApiService;

      // Get the ApiService with the GeneralUtility or by dependency injection
      $apiService = GeneralUtility::makeInstance(ApiService::class);
      // Initialize the service for a site and get the client
      $client = $apiService->initialize($site)->getClient();
      // Or get the client from an already initialized service
      $clientInOtherScope = (GeneralUtility::makeInstance(ApiService::class))->getClient();

#. Use the client

   .. code-block:: php

      // @link https://github.com/onlime/bexio-api-client/tree/main/src/Bexio/Resource
      use Bexio\Resource\Contact

      $bexioContact = new Contact($client);
      $contacts = $bexioContact->getContacts();
